Flattening functions:
Overall time estimate: 0.000000 weighted by profile: 0.000000

Deciding on inlining of small functions.  Starting with size 0.
node context cache: 0 hits, 0 misses, 0 initializations

Reclaiming functions:
Reclaiming variables:
Clearing address taken flags:

Deciding on functions to be inlined into all callers and removing useless speculations:
Overall time estimate: 0.000000 weighted by profile: 0.000000

Why inlining failed?
