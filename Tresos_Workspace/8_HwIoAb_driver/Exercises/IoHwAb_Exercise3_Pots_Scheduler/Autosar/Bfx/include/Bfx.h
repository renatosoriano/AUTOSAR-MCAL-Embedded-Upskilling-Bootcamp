 * @brief   **Specification of Bit Handling Routines**
 *
 * AUTOSAR Library routines are the part of system services in AUTOSAR architecture and below figure
 * shows position of AUTOSAR library in layered architecture.
 *
 * Bfx routines specification specifies the functionality, API and the configuration of the AUTOSAR
 * library for BIT functionality dedicated to fixed-point arithmetic routines All bit functions are
 * re-entrant and can handle several simultaneous requests from the application.
