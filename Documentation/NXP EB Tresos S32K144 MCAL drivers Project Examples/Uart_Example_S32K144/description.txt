    1.2 The aplication description
            - The first welcome message is sent via UART: "Hello, This message is sent via Uart!"
            - The second welcome message is sent via UART: "Have a nice day!"
            - User need to check return status of Send_Data() function for verifying example.
2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Hardware preparation
            - S32K144EVB-Q100 29248 PCB RevA SCH RevC
            - 1 microUSB type B cable
            - 1 Personal Computer
            - 1 S32Debugger: Lauterbach
        2.2.2 Connections
            - It uses Lpuart instance 0, comunicates with Flexio instance 0 channel 0 for Rx and channel 1 for Tx (connect PTC3 (J4.16) - PTD2(D6)(J6.3) and PTB0 (J4.5) - PTE5(D7)(J6.18)).
        2.2.3 Debugger
            - Connect Lauterbach to JTAG port on the board.

    2.2 Software installation
        2.2.1 Tresos Project Installation
            The following procedure requires that the user has EB Tresos Studio installed and it is only needed for viewing, updating and generating the driver's configuration.
            Procedure:
                1. Make sure that all RTD plugins are already installed in the Tresos Studio plugins directory
                2. Open Tresos Studio
                3. Import example application project
                    a. Click on "File" and select "Import"
                    b. Select "Existing Projects into Workspace" and click on "Next" button
                    c. Select "Select root directory" and click on "Browse"
                    d. Select the location of the [project] folder in the installed example application package folder
                    e. Optional* - Select "Copy projects into workspace"
                    f. Click on "Finish" button
        2.2.2 Example configuration
            The following procedure requires that the user has EB Tresos Studio installed and the toolchains versions specified in the Release Notes.
            The toolchain that will be used needs to be installed for correct operation and the path to the installation location shall be added into the system environment variable(s):
            - TRESOS_DIR the installation path of Electrobit Tresos (used for generating the project from command line)
                Ex: TRESOS_DIR = C:/EB/tresos
            - GCC_DIR The path to the GCC instalation dir
                Ex: GCC_DIR = C:/build_tools/gcc_v9.2/gcc-9.2-arm32-eabi
            - PLUGINS_DIR The path to the RTD plugins directory
                Ex: PLUGINS_DIR = C:/NXP/SW32_RTD/eclipse/plugins
            Procedure:
                1. Open project_parameters.mk file in a text editor and update the variables mentioned above with the correct paths
                2. Open "Makefile" file in a text editor and add path to the Uart header directory to INCLUDE_DIRS+=
                    Ex: $(PLUGINS_DIR)/Uart_$(AR_PKG_NAME)/include
3. Building the example application
    3.1 Compiling the application
        Procedure:
            1. Open the Windows command prompt window
            2. Change the current directory to the example application folder
            3. To build the example, execute the following command to build: make build
            4. The object files and linker output file (main.elf) shall be generated in the /out subdirectory
    3.2 Running the application on the board
        To execute the example application from your command line execute make run. For executing the script in a T32 window already open the paths from run.cmm need to be changed relative to the debug folder instead of the example root folder.
    3.3 Modifying the configuration in Tresos and generating the code
        Users may change the application configuration according to their needs.
        Procedure:
            1. Open the EB Tresos Studio GUI
            2. Open previously imported Example Application project
            3. Use the Tresos Studio GUI to modify configuration parameter values and save the changes.
            4. Select the Example Application project and click on "Generate" button to generate the configuration files.
